## About

This project was created to share the UI, agnostic logics and theme throughout the core apps.

## Getting Started

1. Make sure you have [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed.
2. Install your dependencies

   ```
   cd path/to/shared-ui-elements
   npm install
   ```

3. Start Storybook

   ```
   npm run storybook # Runs storybook
   ```

## Path import alias

This project utilizes alias only for the storybook implementation, the modules to be exposed in the package are not aliased since the package will be consumed by the core apps and they may not have the same alias configuration nor the same folder structure.

## Adding dependencies

Ensure that new dependencies are added to both devDependencies and peerDependencies if required in the client's project.

## Installing in Your Client Session

When installing the `@verifiedinc/shared-ui-elements` package, you have access to different export paths optimized for specific use cases.

### Default ESM Export (Recommended)

The packageâ€™s default export path `'./'` uses ECMAScript modules (ESM), providing an optimized build for modern JavaScript environments. This approach is recommended for most applications:

```bash
npm install @verifiedinc/shared-ui-elements
```

```typescript
import { SomeComponent } from '@verifiedinc/shared-ui-elements';
```

This setup is efficient and works seamlessly with frameworks like Next.js, Vite, and other ESM-compatible environments.
